# Portfolio for Marija Peraić

View at [marijap.com](http://marijap.com)

Portfolio page for UX designer Marija Peraić. It uses some modified Bootstrap components, namely: grid and modal windows.

This project has been a great introduction for me to using npm and sass, and understanding the structure of Bootstrap.

It has also been a good experience to learn the value of prototyping and fast workflow as the page went through many iterations
